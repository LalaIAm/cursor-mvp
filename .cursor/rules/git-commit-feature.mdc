require:
    description: Ensure feature development occurs on a dedicated branch and code changes are committed.
    when: implementing_a_new_feature
    steps:

- Create a new branch in the Github repository before starting feature work.
- Commit the branch to the repository before any code implementation.
- After implementing the feature, commit all code changes to the branch before any further
development.
- Do not implement features directly on the main or default branch.
